# FakeEngine

**CAUTION**: The Development of this Game Engine is currently paused because I am working in a team on a new GameEngine. For timing reasons I stopped therefore the development of my own.
The new GameEngine I am working on is open source as well, so here you go: https://github.com/HighLo-Engine/HighLo-Engine

This is the FakeEngine. It is a graphics Engine capable of 2D and 3D made by Can Karka.
The Title is still work in progress, as well as the engine itself.
By the end of the journey the engine should be able to run ultra fast games and 3D applications.

# Getting started

To run the Engine with Visual Studio, just run the CreateSolutions.bat file. It is automatically going to build the Solution files.

# Sandbox Solution

The Sandbox solution is meant to be a playground for new features of the engine. It may change quite often because it always will be under heavy development.

# LevelEditor Solution

The LevelEditor Solution should contain the LevelEditor of this GameEngine. Only working features will be added here to ensure a high level of quality. Therefore there won't be as often updates to this solution as to the Sandbox Solution.
